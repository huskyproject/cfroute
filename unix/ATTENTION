ATTENTION!

Cfroute presently only works on little-endian 32-bit hardware with gcc as
compiler. In particular, it has only been tested on Linux/i386 and
FreeBSD/i386, and in particular it will not run on Linux/alpha, OSF/alpha,
and AIX/rs6000. 

I intend to remove platform-dependent code in the future, i.E. the next
release will probably also run on any other platform, but the current one
doesn't.
