Changes done to CFRoute by Tobias Ernst
=======================================

This file is the changelog for the development version. It  will be merged 
into whatsnew.eng in a condensed form everytime an official release of
CFRoute is made.

19981228
--------
Reworked the FASTECHOPACK interface:
- QQQ files are no longer created in the OUTBOUND directory. You now must
  specify a separate QQQOUTBOUND directory.
- FASTECHOPACK will only write QQQ files if the netmail does NOT have special
  attributes (like Crash, Immediate, Hold, Direct), and if the system that
  the netmail is routed to is one of your "links", i.E. a system that is
  either listed in the Fastecho configuration file or that has an explicit
  packet password. In all other cases, CFRoute will put the netmail directly
  and unpacked into the Binkley outbound.
- If you want to revert to the behaviour of CFRoute 0.94, which always wrote
  QQQ files, even for crash mail or for mail not adressed to any of your links
  (which is IMO not a good idea because Fastecho will then create ARCed 
  mail bundles for systems that you probably do not have a session password
  with, and most systems do not automatically process unsedure arcmail),
  you can specify FASTECHOPACK ALL in the CFRoute config file.

19981219
--------
- If "IgnoreBSY" is NOT specified in the config file (i.E. if cfroute
  is configured to check for BSY flags before doing anything in the
  outbound), cfroute will now also *create* a BSY flag before it does
  anything in the outbound.
- Added UNIX (Linux and FreeBSD) version, along with the necessary changes
  to the source code.

19981204
--------
- enabled support for Squish netmail areas

19981129
--------
- Cleaned up the source code tree.
- Added some "#pragma pack(1)" statements that were required for the EMX
  GCC compiler.
- CFRoute did not recognize the "Direct" bit in .MSG style netmail
  messages. Fixed. (I assume the "direct" bit to be bit #11 in the attrib
  word. Carlos has marked this as "unused", but MsgEd and others use this
  bit for the "direct" flag).
- Changed the behaviour of "VIABOSSDIRECT". Normally, if VIABOSSDIRECT is
  given in the config file, mails for points that are flagged crash, direct
  or  immediate are routed to the boss of the point. I do not have changed
  this for most cases. My modification is that if the boss of the point is
  ourselves, the mail is not routed to ourselves, but direct, crash or
  immediate to the respective point. (Routing mail to ourselves does not
  make much sense, does it?)
- Fix: The random number was not properly seeded if the "-I" command line
  switch was given, which caused CFRoute to always create the same QQQ
  file names on each run (and probably lead to mail losses because Fastecho
  will happily pack a QQQ file into an archive where a file of the same
  name already exists).
- Year 2000 fix on GetJulianDate in datetime.cpp
