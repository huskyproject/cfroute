1. What is CFRoute?
-------------------
    In short, CFRoute is a netmail packer for Binkley-style mailers.
Most mailers currently in use  support this efficient handling. The
only exception I know of is FrontDoor. MainDoor, Xenia, Binkley (of
course), Binkley-XE, McMail, Portal of Power, etc, support BT-style.
    CFR fully supports static (=BT-style)  netmail routing, and has
several features that are unique to it.

2. General features
-------------------
    - Routes can be defined not only using the destination node but
      all  other  information  available: Origin  node,  encryption,
      file attached and day of the week.
    - Different flavors  can be defined for  any combination of the
      routing factors, for example you can send messages to your RC
      crash if they were  written by you but hold them  if they are
      just in transit at your system.
    - Unlimited number of routes, AKAs, netmail directories, packet
      passwords,  etc.  Only   limited  by  available   memory.  No
      harcoded limits at all.
    - Powerful and flexible configuration file parser.
    - Writes  type  2 (FTS-0001, stone age) and  type 2+ (FSC-0039)
      packets.
    - Parses via lines to get complete path information.
    - Detects loops.
    - Powerful wildcarding system, supporting ?, * and #.
    - Compiled for OS/2, Linux, DOS and Windows-32.
    - Complete domain support.
    - Long filenames supported.
    - Optionally generates FastEcho .QQQs instead of .UTs.
    - Can import data from FastEcho.
    - Freeware.
    - Source code (C++) available.
    - Documentation available in English (and an outdated version in
      Spanish).

3. Running CFRoute
------------------
    There  are  four files included in the CFR package.  CFR-DOS is
the DOS version.   CFR-OS2  is  the  OS2  version.   CFR-WIN is the
Windows/32 version.  CFR-LNX is the Linux version, which also  runs
on FreeBSD if the linux compat packages are installed.
    Routes are defined  in one  or more  configuration  file, which
will be explained later. There are a few command line parameters.
    One of them (order isn't  important) has to be a  configuration
file. Mine is called ROUTE.CFR but  you can use any  name you like.
You may use  several configuration  files if you want. Usually  the
main file imports the others as will be explained later, but it  is
correct to load more than one file from the command line. Example:

    CFR-OS2 route.cfr password.cfr

    These switches are supported:

    -?  Get a help screen.
    -I  ignore file dates. By  default, when  CFRoute  is  run,  it
        saves the date and time. This way it can skip messages that
        are older (thus they have been processed already) which  is
        a lot faster than processing them all again. Unfortunately,
        it is possible that some  program tries to get  clever (the
        only program  I know of  is NetMgr) and modifies  a message
        but keeps the original file date (don't confuse the date of
        the message and the date  of the .MSG file; we  are talking
        about the later now). If you are  using such a  program, it
        is wise to use -I in the first run after using it.
    -D  If used, CFR will dump the configuration  file(s) as it has
        parsed them. If you think CFR may be doing something wrong,
        try -D.
        Also, -D will  force CFR to tell  which routes are  matched
        the message being processed.
        So if the problem relates to the configuration, -D will let
        you fix it quickly.
    -V  Log via lines. Log  will be  very large if used, but may be
        helpful some times. Note that  CFR can parse via  lines and
        log just the addresses, which is a lot more useful.

4. Configuration files.
-----------------------
    Before getting to the routing, there are a few rules  that need
to be  explained regarding  the parsing of the  configuration files
(and how to changing those rules).

     A.  Lines starting with ; are considered  to be comments,  and
         not parsed. There  is  an exception  to this: If the  line
         starts with ;CFR then  it will be  parsed (ignoring ;CFR).
         Why this? Because  this  allows  to share a  file  between
         several programs. Say you are using  FastEcho and want  to
         try CFRoute for a few days. You can edit ROUTE.FE a bit to
         add some stuff for CFRoute and still use the file with FE.
         Example:

         ;CFR NETMAIL C:\NETMAIL

         CFRoute  will  parse  that and  get its  required  netmail
         directory, while FastEcho will ignore the line.

     B.  - Any word that is not a verb, is  considered a  parameter
           for the previous verb.
         - A verb ends the parsing of the previous verb.
         - You can  use any number of  tabs and spaces you like  to
           keep your configuration files readable.

         In short, these three sentences mean that you may  write a
         word in a different line, or all the configuration  in the
         same line, etc. For CFR it doesn't make a difference.
         If  you are  used to "one verb  one line" and  prefer that
         end of line means end of command, use the keyword

         EOLENDSCOMMAND.

     C.  Routes  are  processed  bottom-up, which  means  that  the
         *LAST* route that matches  the message data  will be  used
         (the same way as FastEcho's pack). If you  use Squish, you
         may prefer that  the first route is used instead. Use  the
         keyword

         TOPDOWN.

      D. When  completing  addressed, CFR  will  use  the  previous
         address used for a command of the  same type. AKAs will be
         completed with the previous AKA or the main address (which
         has to be complete as explained below). Addresses in route
         sentences will be completed  with the previous  address in
         that sentence (the first address must be complete), etc.

      E. Attributes in the messages have  priority over routing. So
         a message with the crash bit set will be set crash even if
         there is a route sentence for it. By default messages that
         are not to  be routed (crash, hold, etc) are  sent to  the
         destination. Two keywords change this behaviour:

         VIABOSSHOLD -> Hold messages for points are hold for their
                        bosses.
         VIABOSSDIRECT -> Direct  (and  crash, immediate,  etc) are
                          route through their bosses.

         Usually VIABOSSHOLD will  be  used  and VIABOSSDIRECT will
         not.  (Note by Tobias:  This is Carlos'  opinion.   On  my
         configuration, I do use VIABOSSDIRECT ...)

    Before  the  routing,  there  are  a few things that need to be
defined.  This is a list of the verbs that may be used.

- LOG filename
  The name of  the file for logging. CFR logging is very extensive.
  It logs  the complete  message header, the system the  message is
  sent of, the age (in days) of the  message and its body size.
  Other information such as the path it followed before  getting to
  our system or the via line are optional.
  Example:
  LOG P:\CFROUTE.LOG

- NETMAIL netmail_directory
  Where .MSGs (Fido Netmails in the Fido *.MSG (Opus) message  base
  format)are  stored.   At  least  one  must be specified.  You may
  specify as many as you want.  Long directory names are supported.
  Example:
  NETMAIL O:\NETMAIL\MAIN
  NETMAIL O:\NETMAIL\Hauke_Hagenhoff

- NETSQUISH squish_netmail_directory
  Alternatively, or of course in addition to, NETMAIL, you may want
  to  specify  a  Netmail  area in Squish file format.  Specify the
  base name of the squish  area,  but  do  NOT use a "!" as prefix!
  Example:  NETSQUISH O:\SQUISHBASE\NETMAIL

- OUTBOUND outbound_main_outbound_directory.
  Make sure it is the same as the mailer's. Required.
  Example:
  OUTBOUND Q:\FILES\MAIL\FIDO

- MAIN address.
  Your main (primary) address. It must be 4D or 5D.
  Example:
  MAIN 2:341/70@fidonet.org

- AKA address [address...]
  Additional system  addresses. If they are  not complete, CFR will
  get the missing parts  from the  previous AKA  or from  the  main
  address.
  Example:
  MAIN 2:341/70@fidonet.org
  AKA 62 79 93:341/110@subnet.org 150 160
  generates the following address list
  2:341/70@fidonet.org
  2:341/62@fidonet.org
  2:341/79@fidonet.org
  93:341/110@subnet.org
  93:341/150@subnet.org
  93:341/160@subnet.org

- PACKET2 address [address..]
  List of systems that will complain if a packet is type 2+ and not
  2. I have  never heard  of a  program that  will  process type  2
  packets but not type 2+, but just in case the verb is there.
  Example:
  PACKET2 2:341/70 62

- PASSWORD password address [address..]
  Defines the password to add  to the .PKTs generated by CFR. There
  is a discussion on NET_DEV about packet passwords, being the most
  general opinion that  they are useless. I share that  opinion but
  in case you really want to do some extra work...
  Wildcards are accepted.
  Example:
  PASSWORD EXAMPLE 2:341/70 62

- INCLUDE filename
  Processes a file  as part of the  configuration. Include's can be
  nested, i.e. you  can call a  new file from a file  already being
  included.
  Example:
  INCLUDE password.cfr

- CHECKFILE filename
  If the  file exists, CFR terminates  inmediately. Main use  is to
  avoid running CFR and a tosser at the same time.
  Example:
  CHECKFILE H:\FESEM\FEBUSY.*
  is used here to end CFR if FastEcho is running.
  You can specify as many filenames as you wish (CFR will terminate
  if any of them exists) and you can use wildcards.

- FECONFIG <fastecho directory>
  If no directory is specified, CFRoute will check in the directory
  specified in the enviroment variable FE and the current dir.
  Processing of  FastEcho's FASTECHO.CFG takes place  after reading
  CFR's  config, regardless  of where  FEConfig is  found. CFR will
  take the following data from FastEcho:
        - The netmail directory, if none  is specified in CFR's own
          config.
        - The outbound directory, if none is specified in CFR's own
          config.
        - All system addresses not specified in CFR's own config.
        - Packet passwords  for systems not  specified in CFR's own
          config.

- ASSUMEPOINTS and ASSUMEWAYPOINTS.
  See routing.

- EOLENDSCOMMAND
  Explained above.

- TOPDOWN
  Explained above.

- LOGPATH
  If used,  CFRoute  will  parse via  lines and  log  the path  the
  message followed. (explained with detail later).

- DEFINE macro_name anything ENDDEFINE
  Defines a macro, which can then be used anywhere. Example:
  DEFINE GEORGE_PEACE 1:270/101 ENDDEFINE
  DEFINE NORTH_AMERICA 1:* ENDDEFINE
  DEFINE REST_FIDO 2:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:* ENDDEFINE
  ROUTE-TO GEORGE_PEACE NORTH_AMERICA
  Even...
  DEFINE ROUTE_AMERICA ROUTE-TO G_PEACE NORTH_AMERICA ENDDEFINE
  and them
  ROUTE_AMERICA to do the actual work.

- FASTECHOPACK [ALL]
  If you run Fastecho as your Tosser and want the Netmail for  your
  links  to  be archived together with the echomail arcmail bundles
  (like Fastecho does when Fastecho  is  used for Routing), you can
  use the FASTECHOPACK parameter to instruct CFRoute to create .QQQ
  files in the Fastecho "temporary outbound" directory  instead  of
  .?UT files in the Binkley outbound.  You can then call

  "FASTECHO PACK -R<name of empty routing file>"

  directly  after  running  CFroute, and Fastecho will compress the
  .QQQ files into the arcmail bundles.

  If FASTECHOPACK is specified  without any parameter, CFRoute will
  only create QQQ files for  packets  that  are  addressed  to  any
  system  which is either listed in the Fastecho configuration file
  (see FECONFIG keyword)  or  has  a  packet  password defined (see
  PASSWORD keyword), and the mail does not carry any of the  crash,
  immediate, direct or hold falgs.

  If  you  specify  FASTECHOPACK ALL, CFroute will always write QQQ
  files.  I don't see why anybody would want to use this option, as
  Fastecho will then create  arcmail  packets (packed with ARC) for
  unknown systems, which is a bad idea, because most  node  systems
  do not automatically uncompress arcmail packets from systems with
  which  they  don't  have a session password.  Also, Fastecho will
  disregard any  crash,  immediate,  direct  or  hold flavours hwen
  packing .QQQ files.  I only included the ALL option in  order  to
  be  able  to  simulate  the  behaviour of CFRoute 0.94a and older
  versions, although this behaviour does  not  make any sense in my
  opinion.

- NODOMAINDIR
  By default CFRoute uses domain to determine the  directory  where
  outbound  queues are stored.  However some mailers such as Portal
  of Power do  not  use  domain  information  for this.  Also, some
  users of mailers like  Binkley  XE  do  not  configure  a  domain
  outbound.   Use NODOMAINDIR if you do not have a domain outbound,
  that means if you have directories like "outbound.015" instead of
  "gernet.015".

- KILLINTRANSIT
  By default CFRoute only deletes message with the kill/sent  flag.
  However  I've  got  some  request from Squish users to delete all
  in-transit mail even if it doesn't have the kill/sent flag.  I do
  not think that is correct so  I have added this keyword to change
  the default behaviour.

- IGNOREBSY
  CFR honors .BSY flags.  If there is a message to  be  sent  to  a
  node  that  is  now connected, CFR will not pack the message, but
  leave it untouched until the  .BSY dissapears.  Also, at the time
  CFRoute starts to pack a message, it  creates  a  .BSY  flag  and
  deletes  it after it has finished.  If you want CFR to ignore the
  .BSY files, use this keyword.  Be  aware that this may cause mail
  losses.  Do not use it unless you know what you are doing.

5. Routing
----------
    I think it will be  familiar to any one, at least to  users  of
FrontDoor, MainDoor, FastEcho, etc.
    Rule: CFR will not touch any  message if it doesn't  know where
to send it. So you may safely add  route-to sentences and  try them
without affecting messages without a route.
    As said before, CFR uses the  last route sentence that  matches
the data  of the  message being  processed. You may  use TOPDOWN to
make it use the first match.
    There are four   routing verbs, each  with three  flavours. You
can  use dashes  or not,  whatever  you think  is  better  for  the
readibility of your configuration.
    Verbs suffixed with -TO affect to all  messages. Verbs suffixed
with -MAIL affect  to messages without a  file attached, and  verbs
suffixed with -FILES affect to messages with a file attached.

ROUTE-TO, ROUTE-MAIL and ROUTE-FILES
------------------------------------
    Syntax:
    VERB [flavour]   [day  of  the  week]   [encryption]   waypoint
         to_addresses  <EXCEPT  to_addresses> <FROM  from_addresses
         <EXCEPT from_address>>

    Actually the  syntax is  very flexible  and the  only important
thing to keep in mind is the order of the addresses. You can  write
the flavour, day of the week, etc anywhere.
    First address  is always the  waypoint, that  is the  node  the
messages that  matches the route  sentence have to be  sent to. The
waypoint must be 4D or 5D (if you specify a domain it will  be used
for the directory name, if you don't CFR  will match your addresses
to the  waypoint to  find the  correct  domain),  and may not  have
wildcards.
    The next addresses are the destination of the messages that are
affected by this route sentence. These addresses may have wildcards
and may be except'ed. The following wildcards are supported:

    ? -> Zero or one character. 2:34? matches 2:34, 2:341, 2:342...
    # -> One character. 2:34#  matches 2:341, 2:342... but does not
         match 2:34.
    * -> Zero or more characters, 2:34* matches 2:34, 2:341, 2:3412
         etc.

    An address or group of addresses may be except'ed, which  means
that the  sentence will  not affect  the except'ed  addresses.  For
example

    2:34* EXCEPT 2:341/*

    affects  the whole R34 (Spain)  except net  2:341 (Madrid). You
may use several excepts, for example

    2:34* EXCEPT 2:341/* 2:343/* EXCEPT 2:341/70

    affects Spain except Madrid and Catalonia, plus me.

    Addresses  found  after a FROM affect  to  the  sender  of  the
message. EXCEPT may be used here as well. We will see some examples
about this.
    flavour is the priority of the message, and may be  NORMAL, DIR
(for DIRECT),  CRASH or  HOLD. I  assume that  you know  what these
mean for  mailers I so  will  not explain  futher. If there  is  no
flavour, NORMAL is assumed.
    Day of the week refers to the day the messages are  packed, not
when they were written. This is useful if you have a  connection to
someone only once or twice  a week, so those  days it is  faster to
use that connection but the rest of the  week it is better to use a
different  route.  M=Monday,  T=Tuesday,  W=Wednesday,  H=Thrusday,
F=Friday, S=Saturday, U=Sunday.
    ENC  and  NONENC are  used to  route messages  that are  either
encrypted or  non-encrypted. For  example,  if  you  want  to  send
non-encrypted  messsages to  George  Peace  but  not  non-encrypted
because you  know his  tracker will  bounce them  (I invented  this
situation; please don't ask George about this) you would use

    ROUTE-TO NONENC 1:270/101 *

    Currently CFRoute only knows that a message is encrypted if the
own message  flies the  flag  ENC. I  thought of  writting a  small
detection  route,  but  I decided  that people  using  FidoNet  for
encrypted messages  should signal it, to  assist people  willing to
route  such  messages. If one  prefers  not  to signal  the use  of
encryption just to try if the messages gets through then...

    By default, a waypoint is only a  waypoint and nothing  else is
assumed. This means that CFRoute will not  assume that you want  to
route message to the waypoint through it. So

    ROUTE-TO 2:341/70 2:341/62

    means route all mail to 2:341/62 via 2:341/70. Nothing else. If
you want it to  mean 'route all mail  to 2:341/62 and 2: 341/70 via
2:341/70' use the keyword ASSUMEWAYPOINTS. I do not recommend using
it because sooner or later you will find a route map that cannot be
defined using it. However it is up to you to decide.
    Also, 2:341/62 means 2:341/62.0, not 2:341/62.*. If you want to
route all  mail to  2:341/62.*, you  have  to  use .*. There  is  a
keyword to change that, ASSUMEPOINTS. If used, addresses  without a
point specification will be parsed as .*. Again, I do not recommend
using it.
    Macros: As  explained before,  you may  define your own macros,
which you may use anywhere. There are a few predefined  macros that
are usually helpful. Say these three addresses  are defined for the
system: 2:341/70, 2:341/79, 93:341/110.1

    MYZONES  -> Replaced with AKA_1_zone:* AKA_2_zone:*, etc
                (2:*, 93:*)
    MYNETS   -> Replaced with AKA_1_zone:AKA_1_net/*, etc.
                (2:341/*, 93:341/*)
    MYPOINTS -> Replaced  with  AKA_1_zone:AKA_1_net/AKA_1_node.*,
                etc.
                Note that MYPOINTS  only applies to node addresses,
                not point addresses.
                (2:341/70.*, 2:341/79.*)
    LOCAL    -> Replaced by all local addresses.

DIRECT-TO, DIRECT-MAIL and DIRECT-FILES
---------------------------------------
    Syntax  is the  same as  for route-*, except  that there  is no
waypoint. Messages are  addressed directly to the  destination. The
most common example is

    DIRECT MYPOINTS

    at the end of the configuration file.

ROUTE-BOSS, ROUTE-BOSS-MAIL and ROUTE-BOSS-FILES
------------------------------------------------
    Also known as NO-ROUTE, NO-ROUTE-MAIL and NO-ROUTE-FILES (these
are be supported  as well). Netmail is  packed for the  destination
NODES, so a netmail for 2:341/14.23 is bundled along  with mail for
2:341/14. I don't like calling this 'no-route' because some routing
exists after all.
    Note that DIRECT packs netmail for  the destination, even if it
is others point.

NOPACK, NOPACK-MAIL and NOPACK-FILES
------------------------------------
    Netmail is not touched and is left alone in the netmail folder.
For example say you don't want to route netmail to FidoNet from any
othernet.

    NOPACK 1:* 2:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:* FROM * EXCEPT
           1:* 2:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:*

6. Easy routing examples
------------------------
   (don't try to find a use for all of them).

         A. - ROUTE-TO 2:348/201 1:* 2:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:*
            - ROUTE-TO 2:348/201 CRASH 2:34/0
              Send   to   Manuel  Fuentes   the  netmail   for  his
              administrative  address (RC)  crash. Netmail  for his
              other AKAs and the rest of FidoNet is packed normal.
              Remember  that  anything  before a  new command  is a
              parameter. So you can put the attribute specification
              anywhere before the next command.
              So these two lines are the same
              ROUTE-TO CRASH 2:348/201 2:34/0 and
              ROUTE-TO 2:348/201 2:34/0 CRASH

         B. - ROUTE-TO 2:348/201 CRASH 2:34/0 FROM 2:34*/0
              Send netmail to RC34 *from* the  NCs crash. Any other
              message will not  match this route-to and will follow
              the default route, if any.

         C. - ROUTE-TO 1:270/101 1:* FROM 2:341/*
              Netmail to zone 1 from net 341 sent to George Peace's
              place. Netmail from  other nets will  not be  sent to
              George.

         D. - ROUTE-TO 2:348/201 FROM 1:*
              All netmail *from* zone 1  is sent to 2:348/201. Does
              not make too much sense in the  real world, but I bet
              someone will use this.

         E. - ROUTE-TO 2:348/201 2:* EXCEPT 2:34*/* EXCEPT 2:348/*
              All netmail to zone 2 except to R34 except to net 348
              is sent to 2:348/201. Notice  that the second  except
              applies  over the first  one and not over the 2:*. So
              all netmail to zone 2 except  Spain + Galicia is sent
              to 2:348/201.
              If you don't understand it yet:
              route-to 2:348/201 2* except (2:34*/* except 2:348/*)
              may help. Of course don't use ( nor ) except for your
              mental operation!

         F. - ROUTE-TO 2:348/201 2:* FROM * EXCEPT 2:341/*
              All netmail to zone 2 not written  by net 341 is sent
              to 2:348/201.

         G. - ROUTE-TO 2:2/0 HF 2:29*
              Send  netmail  to  Belgium  via  ZC/2 (who  lives  in
              Belgium, in  case you  have not  guessed it)  only on
              Thrusdays and Fridays (to use  the call to pickup the
              nodediff).

         H. - ROUTE-TO 93:7000/0 NONENC 93:7000/0
              Netmail to  Subnet->InterNet gateway  is sent  to the
              gateway, as long as it is not encrypted.

         I. - ROUTE-TO 181:30/10@othernet 181:*
              Route mail for 181:* via 181:30/10 and use 'othernet'
              as  base  for  the  outbound  directory.

7. Other things to note about routing and CFRoute
-------------------------------------------------
    (not very well organized thoughts and facts)
    CFRoute honors  ZON (zonegate) and  HUB (Hub/host  gate) flags.
Say we get a message from zone  2 to zone 1 with the zonegate flag,
and

        ROUTE-TO 1:270/101 1:*
        ROUTE-TO 2:348/202 2:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:* 7:*

    a netmail to  zone 1 without  the flag,  would  go  to  George
Peace. However, a netmail flying  the ZON flag is considered to be
sent to 2:2/1 and thus is routed via 2:348/202.
    The hub flag routes the  message using the destination network
host address.
    ASSUMEPOINTS  and  ASSUMEWAYPOINTS   only   apply   for  route
sentences after  them. If  you want  them to affect the whole file
write them before the first route sentence.
    Sometimes the information in  the header of a message  and its
body don't match, i.e. the header  says the message  goes to 30/10
but there is an INTL line  that says it goes  to 2:341/70. In this
case (which I have found several time), INTL wins.
    CFRoute writes  via line in  the most common  format nowadays,
i.e. ^Via node@domain date.time CFRoute version
    CFRoute includes  a powerful  via line  analyzer  that  allows
logging the path a message followed before reaching our system. An
actual example:

Path: 2:244/1453.0 -> 2:244/1500.0 -> 2:244/1120.0 -> 2:2480/62.0 ->
Path: 2:24/99.0

    as stated  before, the via  line analyzer is enabled  by using
the keyword LOGPATH.
    CFRoute also has  the ability of  detecting and logging loops.
If a message  has been at our  system, left, and is now  back, CFR
will log all the via lines starting from the last local one.

8. A working config file
------------------------
    This is my route file. It is not very complex and  it does not
use all the  features of CFR, but may  help to get an  idea of the
complete picture.
    (please don't mind about the comments in Spanish).
