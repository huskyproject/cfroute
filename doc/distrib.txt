public, you can get the file "cfroute-latest.tar.gz" from

    http://cvs.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/cvs2

PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU GET THE BINARY DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVE AND MAKE IT
AVAILABLE TO OTHERS, THE CFROUTE LICENSE ***FORCES*** YOU TO ALSO MAKE AT
LEAST ONE OF THE SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVES AVAILABE ***AT THE SAME
PLACE***!!!
